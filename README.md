# QSH - Web Components

This repository contains custom web elements used to construct the website for the Queer Southern History Project at the University of Alabama. Specific items contained in this repository will be custom frames, image galleries, decorative page elements, and possibly custom theming for Omeka S.

## Usage & License
We need to figure this out

## Other Information
We should probably make a section telling more about the project and the Summersell Center, maybe plug ourselves too? IDK
